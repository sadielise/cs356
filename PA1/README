Description: This program encrypts and decrypts ASCII character files using either a stream or block cipher. 

Arguments:
	1: B (block cipher) or S (stream cipher)
	2: input file name (file should be a multiple of 8 bits)
 	3: output file name
	4: key file name (8 bytes for block, any length for stream)
	5: E (encrypt) or D (decrypt)

Usage: Type "make" to compile the files. This will create a program called "pa1". Run this program with the above arguments. For example, running "./pa1 B input output key E" will encrypt the file named "input" using a block cipher and the key contained in the "key" file and output the results to the "output" file.

Notes: The key files cannot contain newlines. White space will be preserved in both the encryption and decryption process. Encrypting an input file and then decrypting the resulting file will produce a file that exactly matches the input file. If the input file is empty, the output file will be empty.
